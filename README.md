# Alpha-Beta Pruning

### Alphaâ€“Beta Pruning Implementation for Optimal Decision-Making

<br>

## Overview
This project implements the alpha-beta pruning algorithm, an optimization technique for the minimax algorithm. In this repository, the algorithm is being tested on the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It comprises single and multiplayer modes, and the single-player mode uses the alpha-beta pruning algorithm to make decisions.
