# Alpha-Beta Pruning

### The implementation of Alpha–Beta Pruning AI Algorithm in Tic-Tac-Toe

<br>

## Overview
This project implements the Alpha–Beta Pruning algorithm in combination with the Minimax algorithm in Tic-Tac-Toe. It consists of single and multiplayer modes, and the single-player mode uses the alpha-beta pruning algorithm to make decisions.
